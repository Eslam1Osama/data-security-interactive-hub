## ‚ú® Features

This project was built from the ground up to provide a modern, professional, and highly interactive user experience.

- **Live Module Previews:** Each course module is showcased in a card with a live, non-interactive `iframe` preview of the actual webpage.
- **Interactive 3D Background:** A subtle, animated particle system built with `three.js` that responds to mouse movement.
- **3D Card Tilt Effect:** Module cards tilt and respond to the user's cursor, creating a sense of depth and tactility.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** A seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Smart Sticky Header:** The main header elegantly transitions into a compact, fixed header on scroll, keeping key navigation accessible.
- **Smooth Preloader:** Ensures all assets, including `iframes` and animations, are fully loaded before the page is revealed, preventing content flashing or layout shifts.
- **Light & Dark Mode:** A persistent theme toggle for user preference.
- **Pure JavaScript:** Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance and compatibility. No frameworks needed.
